	about: `I'm a Software Engineer with over two years of experience in full-stack development, currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://github.com/thevrus/vrus.vercel.app" target="_blank" rel="nopener noreferrer" class="font-medium hover:text-indigo-400 hover:underline focus-visible:text-indigo-400">Kennesaw State University</a>. My journey into tech began with Brad Traversy's HTML & CSS crash course on YouTube, sparking my love for building things and turning into a passion for coding and full-stack development.

	Since then, I've worked in various environments, from startups to established companies, focusing on creating user-friendly applications that are attractive, easy to navigate, and efficient behind the scenes. I enjoy simplifying complex tasks to enhance the user experience. Proficient in languages like Java, JavaScript, and Python, I've also worked with frameworks like Spring Boot, React, and Next.js.

	Always open to new opportunities and collaborationsâ€”let's create something amazing together!
